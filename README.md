PCBShopper.com Quote Generator
==============================

This [Eagle](https://cadsoft.io/) ULP script is designed to simplify generating quotes on the [PCBShopper.com](http://pcbshopper.com) website, which aggregates quoting services from ~30 PCB fabs around the world.

Parameters such as board size, layer usage, trace width and hole diameter are automatically pulled from your board design and numerous other options are available through dropdown lists. When you're ready, the link at the bottom of the dialog will direct you to PCBShopper.com where the relevant information will already be inserted into the proper fields. You can make any final changes you'd like before hitting Generate Quote.
